# Loops and Conditional Statements with Python

This notebook contains solutions to various basic Python programming exercises, covering fundamental concepts such as string and list manipulation, conditional statements, and loops.

1.  **String Slicing**:
  (Extracting a portion of a string by specifying start, end, and step indices) used for extracting the first 5 characters from a string.
2.  **List Indexing**:
  (Accessing elements in a list by their numerical position) used for getting the last element of a list.
3.  **String Reversal**:
  (Using slicing with a step of -1 to reverse the order of characters) used for reversing a string.
4.  **List Slicing**:
  (Extracting a sub-list by specifying a range of indices) used for printing elements at even indices from a list of numbers.
5.  **List Modification**:
  (Changing the value of an element at a specific index in a list) used for changing the value of the third element in a list.
6.  **Tuple Access**:
   (Retrieving elements from a tuple using their indices) used for printing the second and last elements of a tuple.
7.  **Type Conversion**:
  (Changing data from one type to another, e.g., tuple to list) used for converting a tuple into a list.
8.  **Conditional Logic (if-elif-else)**:
  (Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute code based on multiple conditions) used for checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
9.  **Conditional Logic (if-else)**:
  (Using `if` and `else` statements to execute code based on a binary condition) used for checking if a number is even or odd.
10. **For Loop**:
 (Iterating over a sequence of elements or a range of numbers) used for printing numbers from 1 to 20.
11. **While Loop**:
 (Repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a condition is true) used for printing numbers from 10 to 1.
12. **Loop for Summation**:
 (Using a loop to iteratively add up elements) used for finding the sum of all elements in a list.
13. **Loop and Condition**:
 (Combining iteration with conditional statements to filter elements) used for printing all numbers divisible by 3 from a list.
14. **List Element Count**:
 (Determining the frequency of a specific value in a list, or all values) used for counting how many times a specific value appears in a list (using `count()` and `collections.Counter`).
15. **Loop for Max Value**:
 (Using a loop and conditional statements to compare and find the largest element) used for finding the largest number in a list.
